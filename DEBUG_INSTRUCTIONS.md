# Debug Instructions for Track Changes

## Current Status
We've implemented a **marks-based track changes** system based on ProseMirror community best practices.

## How to Test

### 1. Open Browser Console
Press `F12` or `Cmd+Option+I` to open developer tools

### 2. Switch to Suggesting Mode
Click the mode selector and choose "Suggesting"

**Expected Console Output:**
```
üîÑ Mode changed to: suggesting
Extension: starterKit
Extension: underline
...
Extension: suggestChanges
‚úÖ Suggest changes enabled: true
```

### 3. Type Some Text
Type "hello world" in the editor

**Expected Console Output:**
```
üîç Processing transaction...
Step: { stepType: 'replace', from: X, to: Y, ... }
‚úÖ Detected insertion: hello world
Modified: true
```

**Expected Visual:**
- Text should appear with **green background and green underline**
- Check HTML: `<span data-type="insertion" class="suggestion-insertion">hello world</span>`

### 4. Delete Some Text
Delete "world"

**Expected:**
- Text should show with **red strikethrough** (but still visible!)
- NOT actually deleted from document

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Console Shows:
- `‚ùå Suggest changes disabled` ‚Üí Mode not set to suggesting
- `‚ùå SuggestChanges extension not found!` ‚Üí Extension not loaded
- `‚ö†Ô∏è No user transaction found` ‚Üí Typing not being detected

### If No Console Output:
- Extension not running at all
- Check if marks are registered: Look for `insertion` and `deletion` in extensions list

### If Text Doesn't Have Green Background:
- Marks might not be applying
- CSS might not be loading
- Check Elements tab in DevTools for `<span data-type="insertion">`

## What Should Happen

**Suggesting Mode ON:**
1. Type ‚Üí Green underline appears inline
2. Delete ‚Üí Red strikethrough (text stays)
3. Sidebar auto-opens showing changes

**Suggesting Mode OFF:**
1. Type ‚Üí Normal typing (no marks)
2. Delete ‚Üí Actually deletes

---

## Current Issues to Check

1. ‚úÖ Are marks defined? (InsertionMark, DeletionMark)
2. ‚úÖ Is extension loaded? (SuggestChangesExtension)
3. ‚ùì Are marks being applied? (Check console for "‚úÖ Detected insertion")
4. ‚ùì Is CSS working? (Check if green/red colors show)
5. ‚ùì Are deletions handled? (Should keep text, just mark it)

---

## Quick Fixes

If nothing works, check:
```typescript
// In LiveDocEditor.tsx, extensions array should have:
InsertionMark,
DeletionMark,
SuggestChangesExtension.configure({ ... })
```

If marks aren't showing:
```css
/* Should be in CSS somewhere */
.suggestion-insertion {
  background-color: #dcfce7;
  border-bottom: 2px solid #16a34a;
}
```
